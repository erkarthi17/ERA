**📚 AI Course Assignments – Extensive & Reimagined**

Welcome to my repository for assignments from the Extensive & Reimagined AI Course.
This repo is a collection of hands-on projects, experiments, and notes that I’ve built while exploring the fundamentals and advanced applications of Artificial Intelligence.

✨ What’s Inside

📝 Assignments – Weekly submissions covering core AI topics

⚙️ Code Implementations – From scratch + framework-based (PyTorch / TensorFlow when applicable)

🔍 Explorations – Experiments beyond the classroom material

📑 Notes & Summaries – Condensed concepts, key takeaways, and reflections

🌟 Contribution

This repo mainly hosts personal coursework.
But if you’re following the same course and want to collaborate, feel free to fork, open issues, or share improvements.

📌 Notes

This repo is a learning diary as much as it is an assignment tracker. 

Expect:

Rough drafts & experiments

Documented bugs + fixes

“Reimagined” takes on traditional problems

🙌 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the course instructors and community for curating such a rich learning experience in AI.
