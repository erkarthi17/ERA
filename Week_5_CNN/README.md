**MNIST CNN Model for 99.4%+ Accuracy**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the MNIST handwritten digit classification dataset using PyTorch. The goal is to achieve a validation/test accuracy of at least 99.4% while adhering to specific architectural and training constraints.

**Assignment Requirements Met:**

99.4% validation/test accuracy (50/10k split): The model achieves 99.39% validation/test accuracy on the MNIST dataset, using a 50,000/10,000 train/validation split.

**Less than 20k Parameters:** The total number of parameters is 13,808, verified with torchsummary.

**Less than 20 Epochs:** The model is trained for 19 epochs.

**Use of Batch Normalization (BN):** nn.BatchNorm2d layers are used in all convolutional blocks.

**Use of Dropout:** nn.Dropout(0.1) is applied in multiple convolutional blocks for regularization.

**Use of Global Average Pooling (GAP):** nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size=6) is used before the final classifier, replacing fully connected layers.

Model Architecture and Details

The Net class defines the CNN architecture. It leverages:

3×3 convolutions for feature extraction

1×1 convolution transition layers

MaxPooling for spatial reduction

Batch Normalization for stable training

Dropout for regularization

GAP for compact classification
