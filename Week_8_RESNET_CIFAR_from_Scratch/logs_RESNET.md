## Training Analysis

### Performance Comparison
| Metric | Run 1 | Run 2 | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Best Validation Accuracy** | 69.85% | 74.86% | **+5.01%** |
| **Final Validation Accuracy** | 69.68% | 74.70% | **+5.02%** |
| **Final Training Accuracy** | 89.57% | 99.65% | +10.08% |
| **Final Loss** | 0.3645 | 0.0278 | **-92.4%** |
| **Overfitting Gap** | 19.89% | 24.95% | +5.06% |

### Key Observations

#### ✅ **Strengths**
1. **Consistent Improvement**: Run 2 shows clear improvement across all metrics
2. **Strong Convergence**: Both runs show stable convergence patterns
3. **Effective Architecture**: ResNet44V2 demonstrates good capacity for CIFAR-100
4. **Good Learning Rate Schedule**: Cosine annealing appears effective

#### ⚠️ **Areas of Concern**
1. **Significant Overfitting**: 25% gap between training and validation accuracy in Run 2
2. **Training Accuracy Saturation**: 99.65% training accuracy suggests potential memorization
3. **Validation Plateau**: Validation accuracy plateaus around epoch 90-95

#### 📊 **Training Dynamics**
- **Early Training (Epochs 1-25)**: Rapid initial learning, good generalization
- **Mid Training (Epochs 25-75)**: Steady improvement, some overfitting begins
- **Late Training (Epochs 75-100)**: Training accuracy continues rising while validation plateaus

### Recommendations for Future Experiments

#### 🔧 **Immediate Improvements**
1. **Early Stopping**: Stop training around epoch 80-85 to prevent overfitting
